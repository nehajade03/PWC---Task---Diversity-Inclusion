## **Problem Statement**
Despite efforts to improve gender balance at the executive management level, our telecom clientâ€™s HR team is not seeing progress. To identify gaps and define actionable strategies, key workforce metrics must be analyzed, including:

- Count of men
- Count  of women
- Count of leavers
-  % employees promoted (FY21)
- % of women promoted
- % of hires men
- % of hires women
- % turnover 
- Average performance rating: men
- Average Performance rating: women

## **Datasource**

The dataset is provided by the [PwC](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/a87GpgE6tiku7q3gu/pw-c-switzerland/power-bi-cqxg/diversity-inclusion) Virtual Job Simulation on Forage, focusing on HR diversity and inclusion metrics.
- Gender, Job Levels, Promotions, Leavers
- Performance Ratings, New Hires, Turnover Rate

## **Data Preparation**

- Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
- Changed data types for consistency (e.g., dates, percentages, integers).
- Created new measures:
     - Turnover Rate (%)
     - Promotion Rate (%)
     - Gender-Specific KPIs (e.g., % Women Promoted, % Hires by Gender).
**Data Analysis 
  And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data modeled.

## **Data Analysis**

The dataset includes several new measures for in-depth analysis:

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Gender distribution and leaver analysis.
2. **Promotion Rates**
   - Overall and gender-specific promotion rates.
3. **Hiring Trends**
   - Analysis of hiring by gender and time.
4. **Turnover Analysis**
   - Overall and gender-specific turnover rates.
5. **Performance Ratings**
   - Average performance ratings by gender.
6. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Propose targeted interventions based on insights.

## **Data Analysis (DAX)**
- **% employees promoted(FY21)** = Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),Filter('Pharma Group AG','Pharma Group AG'[Promotion in FY21?]="Yes")),Calculate(distinctcount('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),Filter('Pharma Group AG','Pharma Group AG'[In base group for Promotion FY21]="Yes")))

- **% Turnover** = Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),Filter('Pharma Group AG','Pharma Group AG'[FY20 leaver?]="Yes")),Divide(Calculate(distinctcount('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),Filter('Pharma Group AG','Pharma Group AG'[In base group for turnover FY20]="Y"))+Calculate(distinctcount('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),Filter('Pharma Group AG',NOT('Pharma Group AG'[Department @01.07.2020]=BLANK()))),2))

- **Average Performance Rating (Men)** = 
AVERAGEX(FILTER('Pharma Group AG', 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Male"), 'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating])

- **Average Performance Rating (Women)** = 
AVERAGEX(FILTER('Pharma Group AG', 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Female"), 'Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating])

- **Female Count** = 
CALCULATE( COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Gender]), 'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Female")

- **Male Count**  = CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Gender]),'Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Male")
  
- **% Hire of Man** = DIVIDE('New Measures'[Male Count],('New Measures'[Male Count]+'New Measures'[Female Count]))
  
- **Hire of Women** = DIVIDE('New Measures'[Female Count],('New Measures'[Male Count]+'New Measures'[Female Count]))

- **Promoted employees in 2021** = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[In base group for Promotion FY21]),'Pharma Group AG'[In base group for Promotion FY21] = "Yes")COUNT('Pharma Group AG'[In base group for Promotion FY21]), 0) * 100

## **Data Visualization (Dashboard)**
